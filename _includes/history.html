                <h2>Green Dot Simulation - Senior Design Project</h2>
                <p>The Green Dot Program is a campus wide initiative to combat interpersonal violence. Within this program there
                    is a training that students, faculty, and employees at the University can participate in and further
                    train themselves to stop acts of interpersonal violence. Participants of the training learn about how
                    to intervene in bad situations and stop acts of violence. The goal of the Green Dot Simulator is to make
                    a more realistic model that generates a simulation of green dotters, red dotters, and neutral dotters
                    on the University of Portland campus with location and time as new enhancements.</p><span class="cd-date">September 2016 - May 2017</span></div>
